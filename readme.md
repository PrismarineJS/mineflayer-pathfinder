Mostly stable. Feel free to contribute by making suggestions or posting issues.

## Install

```bash
npm install mineflayer-pathfinder
```

## Example

```js
const mineflayer = require('mineflayer')
const pathfinder = require('mineflayer-pathfinder').pathfinder
const Movements = require('mineflayer-pathfinder').Movements
const { GoalNear } = require('mineflayer-pathfinder').goals
const bot = mineflayer.createBot({ username: 'Player' })

bot.loadPlugin(pathfinder)

bot.once('spawn', () => {

  const mcData = require('minecraft-data')(bot.version)

  const defaultMove = new Movements(bot, mcData)
  
  bot.on('chat', function(username, message) {
  
    if (username === bot.username) return

    const target = bot.players[username] ? bot.players[username].entity : null
    if (message === 'come') {
      if (!target) {
        bot.chat('I don\'t see you !')
        return
      }
      const p = target.position

      bot.pathfinder.setMovements(defaultMove)
      bot.pathfinder.setGoal(new GoalNear(p.x, p.y, p.z, 1))
    } 
  })
})
```

## Features
 * Optimized and modernized A* pathfinding
 * Complexe goals can be specified (inspired by [baritone goals](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone/blob/master/FEATURES.md#goals) )
 * Customizable movements generator
 * Each movement can have a different cost
 * Can break/place blocks as part of its deplacement
 * Automatically update path when environment change
 * Long distance paths
 * Can swim
 * Can avoid entities
 * Modular and easily extendable with different behavior

## API
Considering there are a lot of deep changes that are being worked on, it could take some time before it's done

Also, **for now**, there is only the `pathfinder` module, `movements` and `goals` still need to be done


# Functions:

### bot.pathfinder.goto(goal)
Returns a Promise with the path result. Resolves when the goal is reached. Rejects on error.
 * `goal` - Goal instance

### bot.pathfinder.bestHarvestTool(block)
Returns the best harvest tool in the inventory for the specified block
 * `Returns` - `Item` instance or `null`
 * `block` - Block instance

### bot.pathfinder.getPathTo(movements, goal, done, timeout)
 * `Returns` - The path
 * `movements` - Movements instance
 * `goal` - Goal instance
 * `timeout` - number (optional, default `bot.pathfinder.thinkTimeout`)

### bot.pathfinder.getPathFromTo* (movements, startPos, goal, options = {})
Returns a Generator. The generator computes the path for as longs as no full path is found or `options.timeout` is reached. 
The generator will block the event loop until a path is found or `options.tickTimeout` (default to 50ms) is reached.
 * `Returns` - A generator instance. See [MDN function*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*).
 * `movements` - Movements instance
 * `startPos` - A Vec3 instance. The starting position to base the path search from. 
 * `goal` - Goal instance
 * `options` - A optional options object contains:
   * `optimizePath` - Boolean Optional. Optimize path for shortcuts like going to the next node in a strait line instead walking only diagonal or along axis.
   * `resetEntityIntersects` - Boolean Optional. Reset the `entityIntersections` index for `movements`. Default: true
   * `timeout` - Number Optional. Total computation timeout.
   * `tickTimeout` - Number Optional. Maximum amount off time before yielding.
   * `searchRadius` - Number Optional. Max distance to search.
   * `startMove` - instance of Move Optional. A optional starting position as a Move. Replaces `startPos` as the starting position.

### bot.pathfinder.setGoal(Goal, dynamic)
 * `goal` - Goal instance
 * `dynamic` - boolean (optional, default false)
 
### bot.pathfinder.setMovements(movements)
Assigns the movements config
 * `movements` - Movements instance

### bot.pathfinder.stop()
Stops path finding when its save to stop or after the bot encountered an error while path finding. To force stop use bot.pathfinder.setGoal(null). Emits `path_stop` when stopped.

### bot.pathfinder.isMoving()
A function that checks if the bot is currently moving.
 * `Returns` - boolean

### bot.pathfinder.isMining()
A function that checks if the bot is currently mining blocks.
 * `Returns` - boolean

### bot.pathfinder.isBuilding()
A function that checks if the bot is currently placing blocks.
 * `Returns` - boolean

# Properties:
### bot.pathfinder.thinkTimeout
Think Timeout in milliseconds
 * `Default` - `5000`

### bot.pathfinder.tickTimeout
How many ms per tick are allocated to thinking
 * `Default` - `40`

### bot.pathfinder.searchRadius
The search limiting radius, in blocks, if `-1` the search is not limited by distance.
 * `Default` - `-1`

# Movement class
This class configures how pathfinder plans its paths. It configures things like block breaking or different costs for moves. This class can be extended to add or change how pathfinder calculates its moves.

## Usage
Pathfinder instantiates the default movement class by itself if no instance is specified. If you want to change values you should create a new instance of the Movements class, change it's values and set it as pathfinders new movement class. 
### Example:
```js
const { Movements } = require('mineflayer-pathfinder') // Import the Movements class from pathfinder

bot.once('spawn', () => {
  // Once we've spawn, it is safe to access mcData because we know the version
  const mcData = require('minecraft-data')(bot.version)

  // A new movement instance for specific behavior
  const defaultMove = new Movements(bot, mcData)

  defaultMove.allow1by1towers = false // Do not build 1x1 towers when going up
  defaultMove.canDig = false // Disable breaking of blocks when pathing 
  defaultMove.scafoldingBlocks.push(mcData.itemsByName['netherrack'].id) // Add nether rack to allowed scaffolding items
  bot.pathfinder.setMovements(defaultMove) // Update the movement instance pathfinder uses

  // Do pathfinder things
  // ...
})
```
